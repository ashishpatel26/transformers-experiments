x corresponded to the right(+)/left( ) direction , y corresponded to the superior(+)/inferior( ) direction , and z corresponded to the anterior(+)/posterior( ) direction .\\nall observations were made by a single radiation therapist with several years of experience in cbct assessment . to determine intrauser variability ,\\nthe stent and l1 marker placements were repeated on three separate occasions for the first five fractions .\\nstent length was approximated by subtracting the inf stent y coordinate from the sup stent y coordinate from the planning ct .\\nvirtual markers were placed at the sup stent on the images associated with maximum inhale and exhale , and the distance between these markers were measured in the superior - inferior direction to estimate the planning stent breathing motion .\\ndaily treatment stent - to - l1 ( stent - l1 ) measurements were determined using the daily cbcts taken immediately before treatment delivery .\\nthe distance between the sup stent and the l1 vertebra was calculated by subtracting the l1 coordinates from the sup stent coordinates ( sup - l1 ) .\\nthe distance between the inf stent and the l1 vertebra was calculated by subtracting the l1 coordinates from the inf stent coordinates ( inf - l1 ) .\\nlimited soft tissue definition on cbct necessitated the comparison of surrogate motion with a bony match as in previous studies [ 7 , 13 ] .\\nonce the sup - l1 and inf - l1 measurements were obtained for each cbct and planning ct , the planning stent - l1 measurements were then subtracted from the treatment stent - l1 measurements to determine the interfraction stent position relative to the baseline planning ct for both the sup stent and the inf stent .\\nthe mean , median , maximum , minimum , and interquartile range of interfraction stent motion was calculated using commercially available statistics software ( ibm spss statistics 20.0 ; ibm corp , armonk , ny ) .\\npoint - based analysis was performed to facilitate comparison with previous studies that examined interfraction stent position change using motion analysis of a single point ( single end of stent   or centre of mass ) . because two points at opposing ends of the stent were used to determine position change for this study , any rotational error was captured as oppositional movement of the two stent ends . also , since endobiliary stents are flexible structures making assessment of rotation alone difficult , using two points of measurement accounted for both potential rotation and potential deformation .\\nthe patients included in this retrospective study had previously provided informed consent for treatment on a research ethics board  approved phase ii trial conducted in accordance with the helsinki declaration of 1964 and its later amendments , examining the effects of a novel radiosensitizer nelfinavir in combination with chemoradiotherapy in patients with lapc between october 2010 and september 2012 .\\nall trial patients with an endobiliary stent implanted at the time of their planning computed tomography ( ct ) scan who underwent daily cbcts during their radiotherapy treatments were included in this analysis .\\ntreatment was planned in the supine position with patients ' hands above their head , arms and head supported by a vacuum bag , and knees supported by a kneefix ( civco medical systems , kalona , ia ) .\\nplanning cts were captured during exhale breath - hold with a 16-slice helical ct scanner ( ge optima kv120 , smart ma , 0.25-cm slices ;

the most inferior aspect of the stent ( inf stent ) ; and the most inferior , posterior aspect of the l1 vertebra central spinous process ( l1 ) . using contouring software , a digital marker was placed at these points for each planning ct and treatment cbct ( figure  1 ) .\\na specific set of x , y , and z coordinates were associated with each marker ; x corresponded to the right(+)/left( ) direction , y corresponded to the superior(+)/inferior( ) direction , and z corresponded to the anterior(+)/posterior( ) direction .\\nall observations were made by a single radiation therapist with several years of experience in cbct assessment . to determine intrauser variability ,\\nthe stent and l1 marker placements were repeated on three separate occasions for the first five fractions .\\nstent length was approximated by subtracting the inf stent y coordinate from the sup stent y coordinate from the planning ct .\\nvirtual markers were placed at the sup stent on the images associated with maximum inhale and exhale , and the distance between these markers were measured in the superior - inferior direction to estimate the planning stent breathing motion .\\ndaily treatment stent - to - l1 ( stent - l1 ) measurements were determined using the daily cbcts taken immediately before treatment delivery .\\nthe distance between the sup stent and the l1 vertebra was calculated by subtracting the l1 coordinates from the sup stent coordinates ( sup - l1 ) .\\nthe distance between the inf stent and the l1 vertebra was calculated by subtracting the l1 coordinates from the inf stent coordinates ( inf - l1 ) .\\nlimited soft tissue definition on cbct necessitated the comparison of surrogate motion with a bony match as in previous studies [ 7 , 13 ] .\\nonce the sup - l1 and inf - l1 measurements were obtained for each cbct and planning ct , the planning stent - l1 measurements were then subtracted from the treatment stent - l1 measurements to determine the interfraction stent position relative to the baseline planning ct for both the sup stent and the inf stent .\\nthe mean , median , maximum , minimum , and interquartile range of interfraction stent motion was calculated using commercially available statistics software ( ibm spss statistics 20.0 ; ibm corp , armonk , ny ) .\\npoint - based analysis was performed to facilitate comparison with previous studies that examined interfraction stent position change using motion analysis of a single point ( single end of stent   or centre of mass ) . because two points at opposing ends of the stent were used to determine position change for this study , any rotational error was captured as oppositional movement of the two stent ends . also , since endobiliary stents are flexible structures making assessment of rotation alone difficult , using two points of measurement accounted for both potential rotation and potential deformation .\\nsix patients accrued from october 2010 to september 2012 were included in this study ( a , b , c , d , e , and f ) with a mean age of 63 years ( range , 6065 years ) and a median gtv of 19.33  cm ( range , 6.45  cm41.10  cm ) .\\ncbcts were acquired for all patients for all 33 radiotherapy fractions with 198 cbcts acquired immediately prior to treatment delivery .\\nthree cbcts were excluded because of software issues and a stent reinsertion , leaving 195 cbcts suitable for stent position analysis . for patient\\na , cbcts acquired on fractions 9 and 19 could not be analysed using the contouring software , leaving 31 fractions available for analysis .\\nsix patients were included in the stent position analysis but assessed as seven ( a , b , c , d , e.1 , e.2 , and f ) because one patient required a stent reinsertion .\\npatient e required a stent reinsertion on fraction 15 as stent patency failure was suspected .\\ntherefore , fraction 15 was omitted from analysis and fractions 114 ( patient e.1 ) were analysed separately from 1633 ( patient e.2 ) .\\nthe initial planning ct provided the baseline stent information for patient e.1 , and a repeat ct scan taken at fraction 15 after stent reinsertion provided the baseline stent information for patient e.2 ( table  1 ) .\\nof the six patients assessed , three patients ( a , b , and f ) exhibited pronounced and sustained stent position changes as determined by examining the individual mean position change for each patient in each direction ( table  2 ) and by visualizing position change graphically over time ( figure  2 ) .\\npatient a showed sustained stent position changes with the sup stent moving to the right ( 2.66  2.77  cm ) and inferiorly ( 3.0   3.12  cm ) and the inf stent moving to the right ( 1.92   2.02  cm ) inferiorly ( 3.233.34  cm ) and posteriorly ( 1.41  1.43  cm ) .\\npatient b showed sustained stent position changes with the inf stent moving superiorly ( 2.23   0.49  cm ) and posteriorly ( 1.72  0.59  cm ) .\\npatient f showed sustained stent position changes with both the sup and inf stent moving inferiorly ( 0.98  0.35  cm and 1.21   0.38  cm , respectively ) . the sustained position change was apparent from the start of treatment for patients b and f but did not become apparent in patient a until after fraction 5 ( figure  2 ) .\\nthe free - breathing superior - inferior stent motion determined from planning for patients a , b , and f were 1.15  cm , 1.87  cm , and 0.53  cm , respectively ( table  1 ) . although the sup and inf stent for patient a and f moved similarly during treatment , only the inf stent for patient b showed sustained position changes ( figures  2 and 3 ) . the population mean position change ( x , y , z )\\n( ie , the mean of all patients ' individual means of position change ) for the sup stent was x=  0.44  1.09  cm , y = 0.45   1.26  cm , and z  =  0.09  0.26  cm .\\nthe population mean position change for the inf stent for all patients was x=  0.33   0.84  cm , y=  0.43  1.65  cm , and z = 0.31  0.95  cm .\\nthe standard deviation of position change (  ) exhibited by the inf stent was greater than that exhibited by the sup stent ( table  2 ) .\\nfor the y component of the stent - l1 distance , six patients ( b , c , d , e.1 , e.2 , and f ) had inf stent &gt; sup stent . for the z component of the stent - l1 distance , five patients ( a , b , c , e.1 , and f ) had inf stent &gt; sup stent .\\nof the six patients assessed , three patients ( a , b , and f ) exhibited pronounced and sustained stent position changes as determined by examining the individual mean position change for each patient in each direction ( table  2 ) and by visualizing position change graphically over time ( figure  2 ) .\\npatient a showed sustained stent position changes with the sup stent moving to the right ( 2.66  2.77  cm ) and inferiorly ( 3.0   3.12  cm ) and the inf stent moving to the right ( 1.92   2.02  cm ) inferiorly ( 3.233.34  cm ) and posteriorly ( 1.41  1.43  cm ) .\\npatient b showed sustained stent position changes with the inf stent moving superiorly ( 2.23   0.49  cm ) and posteriorly ( 1.72  0.59  cm ) .\\npatient f showed sustained stent position changes with both the sup and inf stent moving inferiorly ( 0.98  0.35  cm and 1.21   0.38  cm , respectively ) .\\nthe sustained position change was apparent from the start of treatment for patients b and f but did not become apparent in patient a until after fraction 5 ( figure  2 ) .\\nthe free - breathing superior - inferior stent motion determined from planning for patients a , b , and f were 1.15  cm , 1.87  cm , and 0.53  cm , respectively ( table  1 ) . although the sup and inf stent for patient a and f moved similarly during treatment , only the inf stent for patient b showed sustained position changes ( figures  2 and 3 ) . the population mean position change ( x , y , z ) ( ie , the mean of all patients ' individual means of position change ) for the sup stent was x=  0.44  1.09  cm , y = 0.45   1.26  cm , and z  =  0.09  0.26  cm .\\nthe population mean position change for the inf stent for all patients was x=  0.33   0.84  cm , y=  0.43  1.65  cm , and z = 0.31  0.95  cm .\\nthe standard deviation of position change (  ) exhibited by the inf stent was greater than that exhibited by the sup stent ( table  2 ) .\\nfor the y component of the stent - l1 distance , six patients ( b , c , d , e.1 , e.2 , and f ) had inf stent &gt; sup stent .\\nfor the z component of the stent - l1 distance , five patients ( a , b , c , e.1 , and f ) had inf stent &gt; sup stent .\\nthis study shows that the position of endobiliary stents can vary greatly over the course of ebrt for lapc in six patients . utilizing endobiliary stents as imaging surrogates for pancreatic tumours\\nshould be done cautiously as these stents may lack positional stability during ebrt . in this study , three patients exhibited sustained stent position changes from their planning ct .\\nwe saw a greater rate of stent migration than previously published by johanson et  al , which may be evidence of distal stent migration only .\\nthe migration rate differential may be related to study population selection as johanson 's sample consisted of a generalized patient population that received endobiliary stents , whereas this study had pancreatic cancer patients that received stents prior to chemoradiotherapy .\\nit is unknown how the presence of malignancy , chemotherapy , or ebrt affected stent migration incidence in this study , but the development of radiotherapy - induced pancreatic fibrosis may play a role . while malignancy and chemotherapy may have influenced stent migration , lofts et  al   found that cancer patients on a chemo - regime of epirubicin , cisplatin , and 5-fluorouracil did not have a significant increase in stent blockage or shortening of stent patency duration .\\nsignificant interfraction deformation of the pancreatic head , duodenum , and stomach can occur during pancreatic head irradiation , and these interfraction anatomic changes may affect stent migration . stent migration could be attributed to pancreatic irradiation ; however , other studies have found that endobiliary stents were stable during radiotherapy [ 13 , 19 ] .\\nzhu et  al   found no incidence of stent migration when they treated biliary malignancy with intraluminal radiotherapy , but this may be due to their use of a stent - in - stent configuration .\\nengineer et  al   concluded that endobiliary stents were stable tumour surrogates during ebrt after they found population mean position changes of less than 0.4  cm in all directions during ebrt .\\nwe found similar population mean position changes when patients were analysed together ( &lt; 0.5  cm ) , but when patients were examined individually , three patients exhibited individual mean interfraction motions of greater than 1  cm in at least one direction , indicating stent migration occurrence .\\nthis contradicts the findings of whitfield et  al   who reported that their stent patients had individual mean interfraction stent motions of less than 1  cm for all directions during ebrt .\\nprevious studies that examined cbct - determined interfraction stent motion during ebrt had small samples ( three   and five patients ) . perhaps with larger study sizes , more cases of stent migration would have also presented themselves in these studies .\\nthe more inferior stent position during treatment cbcts may be due to the planning cts being captured during exhale breath - hold and the daily cbcts being captured during free - breathing ; the stents appeared inferior on cbcts because inhalation caused inferior pressure on the diaphragm and abdominal contents . however , not all patients showed more inferiorly positioned stents .\\nthe influence of variable inhale and exhale lung volumes on stent position as seen on free - breathing cbcts is unknown .\\nthe majority of the free - breathing cycle is spent in exhale breath position , which suggests that stent appearance on free - breathing cbct roughly correlates with its appearance on exhale breath - hold ct . the inferior stent position change exhibited by patients a and f was larger than the sup - to - inf breathing motion established during planning .\\ninhalation may not be the only contributing factor to an inferior position change ; distal stent migration may have occurred .\\nthis can not be stated conclusively because 4dct - determined pancreatic tumour motion may not have good correlation with the range of motion demonstrated during radiotherapy [ 21 , 22 ] .\\nother nonrespiratory physiological processes may impact on stent position . to distinguish between interfraction motion and intrafraction motion , more detailed treatment imaging such as 4-dimensional cbct could be used to determine stent positions on respiratory - correlated cbct projections .\\nexhale breath - hold cbcts could also be used to minimize the respiratory component of intrafraction motion and facilitate correspondence with the exhale breath - hold planning ct .\\nideally , stent position would be compared to the pancreas to monitor migration occurrence , but limited soft tissue definition on cbct necessitates the comparison of surrogate motion with a bony match as in previous studies [ 7 , 13 ] .\\nmore accurate soft tissue imaging and further study would be required to determine whether change in stent position is representative of position change of the pancreatic head .\\nmost patients had greater standard deviation of position change exhibited by the inf stent than the sup stent .\\ngreater freedom of movement was associated with the inf stent in the superior - inferior and anterior - posterior planes than the sup stent .\\nsup stent motion was likely restricted by the concentration , size , and rigidity of internal organs in the  upper abdomen .\\nthe magnitude and direction of position change did not correspond for the sup stent and inf stent .\\nthe cause of this is unknown but may be a result of bowel filling changes from planning to treatment or weight loss during treatment .\\nthe incidence of stent deformation reinforces the method of selecting two position points on the stent .\\nprevious studies selected a single stent position point such as a single end of stent or centre of mass [ 11 , 13 ] to assess interfraction stent motion and did not report on stent deformation .\\nas two points at opposing ends of the stent were used to determine position change for this study , any rotational error was captured as oppositional movement of the two stent ends .\\nendobiliary stents are flexible structures , making the assessment of rotation alone difficult . by using two points of measurement , both potential rotation and potential deformation\\ncould be accounted for . because patients were referred from a number of centres , the patients had a variety of both metal and plastic stents in place .\\nalthough the variation in stent type did not affect visualization of the stent on cbct nor did it affect the results , a greater number of patients with both metal and plastic stents are required to determine this statistically .\\na limitation of this study was the small sample size , which did not allow for more robust statistical analysis .\\nthere was considerable diversity between the patients ' results as shown by the large standard deviation of all patients ' means . without more statistical tests ,\\nit is difficult to say whether this diversity would also be found in a larger group of patients .\\nadditional study patients would allow for the identification of possible trends with regards to stent migration as well as enable better extrapolation to the wider irradiated lapc population\\n. other limitations of this study were that the method and timing of stent insertion were not controlled nor was the stent type .\\nwith patients being referred for radiotherapy after stent insertion , controlling the previously mentioned variables will require forethought and coordination .\\ncareful , consistent stent selection and  insertion could reduce or eliminate stent migration . shortening the time frame from stent insertion to the start  and completion of radiotherapy\\nmay also reduce  stent  migration during treatment . for those receiving  short - course radiotherapy for pancreatic cancer [ 2426 ] , the position of the endobiliary stent may be stable  during igrt because of the shorter time span of treatment . for those patients who may undergo long - course radiotherapy with a pre - existing stent , it is worth investigating whether these patients may require an additional procedure to  exchange for a more stable endobiliary stent or to insert  additional fiducials to facilitate image guidance during ebrt .\\nthrough examination of daily treatment images , large sustained endobiliary stent position changes were observed in a small subset of patients during ebrt for lapc , indicating the occurrence of stent migration and deformation .\\nfurther study is needed to determine whether change in stent position is representative of position change of the pancreatic head and tumour , and whether stents are appropriate for use as tumour surrogates .</td>\n",

              "      <td>the axon initial segment ( ais ) is a specialized structure in neurons that resides in between axonal and somatodendritic domains . \\n the localization of the ais in neurons is ideal for its two major functions : it serves as the site of action potential firing and helps to maintain neuron polarity . \\n it has become increasingly clear that the ais cytoskeleton is fundamental to ais functions . in this review , \\n we discuss current understanding of the ais cytoskeleton with particular interest in its unique architecture and role in maintenance of neuron polarity . \\n the ais cytoskeleton is divided into two parts , submembrane and cytoplasmic , based on localization , function , and molecular composition . \\n recent studies using electron and subdiffraction fluorescence microscopy indicate that submembrane cytoskeletal components ( ankyrin g , iv - spectrin , and actin filaments ) form a sophisticated network in the ais that is conceptually similar to the polygonal / triangular network of erythrocytes , with some important differences . components of the ais cytoplasmic cytoskeleton ( microtubules , actin filaments , and neurofilaments ) reside deeper within the ais shaft and display structural features distinct from other neuronal domains . \\n we discuss how the ais submembrane and cytoplasmic cytoskeletons contribute to different aspects of ais polarity function and highlight recent advances in understanding their ais cytoskeletal assembly and stability .</td>\n",
              "      <td>neurons are highly polarized cells that form the basis of directed information flow within the nervous system .\\nthe somatodendritic domain contains the cell body ( soma ) , multiple dendrites , and a short region of the proximal axon adjacent to the soma ( axon hillock ) , while the axonal domain projects a long axon away from the axon hillock toward the next neuron in the neural circuitry or toward a target tissue where it branches into multiple axon terminals that form synapses .\\nfunctionally , information flow commences at the somatodendritic domain , which receives synaptic input from neighboring or distant neurons , and is subsequently transmitted to the axonal domain , which specializes in sending signals to the next neuron in the neural circuitry or to a target tissue .\\nthe functional and morphological polarity of neurons depend on the asymmetric distribution of specific molecules to the axonal and somatodendritic domains .\\nthe establishment of molecular asymmetry between these domains is fundamental to axon specification during early neuron development .\\nhowever , for the long - term maintenance of neuronal function and shape , axons and dendrites must retain their unique molecular components throughout the life of the organism . the axon initial segment ( ais )\\nthe ais is uniquely positioned in the proximal axon , adjacent to and distal from the axon hillock , where it serves two functions : ( 1 ) to integrate synaptic inputs and generate action potentials and ( 2 ) to maintain neuron polarity .\\nthe roles of the ais in action potential initiation and synaptic input integration have been discussed extensively in recent reviews [ 14 ] and will not be reviewed here .\\nthe ais contributes to the maintenance of neuron polarity in at least two ways : first , it serves as a submembrane diffusion barrier that restricts the mobility of plasma membrane components , preventing them from passing from one domain to another [ 5 , 6 ] ; and second , it acts as an intracellular selective filter for the transport of organelles and molecules between these domains through the cytoplasm .\\ntogether , the diffusion barrier and intracellular selective filter help to successfully maintain neuron polarity , and this success is partly due to different aspects of the ais cytoskeleton .\\nin addition to the ais , some neurons contain nodes of ranvier , the small periodic gaps in the myelin sheath that surrounds the axon .\\nnodes of ranvier are partly responsible for the astonishing speed and propagation of signal transmission along the axon . although nodes of ranvier share many features with the ais in terms of protein composition and ability to generate action potentials for saltatory nerve conduction , nodes have not been implicated so far in polarity - related functions and will be discussed only minimally to point out some key similarities or differences relative to ais structure . for recent detailed reviews on the assembly and maintenance of nodes , see [ 7 , 8 ] .\\nthe overall goal of this review is to discuss current understanding of ais cytoskeletal organization and its role in ais function .\\nwe start with an overview of ais structure , followed by a more in - depth review of ais composition and architecture , and how certain features of ais cytoskeletal structure underpin its role in neuron polarity .\\nthe structure of the ais was first investigated by early electron microscopy studies using thin sections of brain tissue [ 9 , 10 ] .\\nthese studies demonstrated two distinct features of ais structure : a dense plasma membrane undercoat and microtubule fascicles , which localize more deeply within the ais cytoplasm .\\nthus , when viewed in cross section , the ais can be divided into three main layers or regions : the plasma membrane ( outermost surface ) , submembrane cytoskeleton corresponding to the plasma membrane undercoat ( middle layer ) , and inner ais shaft ( cytoplasmic region ) ( figure 1 ) .\\nthese layers are integrated by a multidomain scaffolding protein ankyrin g ( ankg ) that functions as a master organizer of the ais .\\nthe plasma membrane of the ais is different from that of the axonal domain ( herein also referred to as the distal axon ) because it is enriched with specialized transmembrane proteins , including voltage - gated ion channels , which confer the unique electrical properties of the ais and nodes of ranvier , and specific cell adhesion molecules ( cams ) .\\nthe submembrane cytoskeleton plays a crucial role in ais polarity function because disrupting its structure compromises axon identity .\\nits protein composition was suggested by light microscopy studies that revealed accumulations of several membrane - binding and cytoskeletal proteins in the ais .\\nthe major cytoskeletal components that are currently known to compose the submembrane ais cytoskeleton include actin filaments , the master organizer of the ais ankyrin g ( ankg ) , and iv - spectrin .\\nthe initial idea about organization and functions of this set of proteins came from studies of erythrocytes , where these or related proteins form a highly stable and elastic cytoskeletal network [ 1115 ] that is important for conferring mechanical stability and resilience to cells as they travel through blood vessels .\\nit is now known that a similar ankyrin - spectrin - actin network , though with different geometry , composes the submembrane cytoskeleton of the ais and distal axon [ 1620 ] and may have functions comparable to those in erythrocytes .\\nthe cytoplasmic region of the ais , the inner ais shaft , contains three major cytoskeletal filaments : neurofilaments , microtubules , and actin filaments .\\nthese cytoskeletal components are ubiquitous in neurons and contribute to various aspects of neuronal morphology , integrity , and function [ 2224 ] . in the ais , these filaments are thought to have additional roles in contributing to different aspects of ais function .\\nbecause of its reputation as the master organizer , ankg may be considered the most important ais constituent . in mammals ,\\nankyrins are encoded by three different genes , ankyrin r ( ank1 ) , ankyrin b ( ank2 ) , and ankyrin g ( ank3 ) , all of which have similar structure and function , and undergo alternative splicing to generate multiple isoforms .\\ntwo large ankg isoforms , 270  kda and 480  kda , are neuron - specific and localize particularly within the ais and along the distal axon in nodes of ranvier [ 26 , 27 ] .\\nthe role of ankg as a master organizer is attributable to the observations that it is the first protein that clusters in the proximal axon following axon specification , recruits almost all other ais proteins to the plasma membrane and submembrane regions [ 2831 ] , and interacts with components within all layers of the ais [ 11 , 16 ] .\\nthe multifaceted activity of ankg in the ais depends in part on the various domains of the ankg molecule .\\nstarting at its n - terminus , ankg contains a membrane - binding domain consisting of 24 ankyrin repeats ( 33-amino acid motifs involved in protein recognition ) , followed by a spectrin - binding domain , a serine - rich domain , a long , likely unstructured , tail , and a c - terminal domain   ( figure 1 ) .\\nankg associates with components in the plasma membrane and with spectrin in the submembrane region through its membrane - binding and spectrin - binding domains , respectively .\\nthe ankg c - terminal tail extends to the inner ais shaft , where it possibly associates with other interaction partners .\\nfor example , ankg is thought to interact with microtubules and bundle them , which may lead to the formation of microtubule fascicles in the cytoplasmic region of the ais , although direct interactions between ankg and fascicles in the ais have yet to be shown .\\nits depletion in neurons disrupts or prevents the formation of the ais ( and nodes of ranvier ) .\\nankg deficiency also contributes to the pathology of several neurological diseases ( e.g. , epilepsy , schizophrenia , bipolar disorder , autism spectrum disorder , and alzheimer 's disease ) [ 33 , 34 ] .\\nmutant mice lacking ankg in their cerebellum develop severe ataxia and an inability to initiate action potentials , likely due to the observed loss of voltage - gated sodium channels at the ais of purkinje neurons [ 28 , 29 ] . in vitro ,\\npurkinje and hippocampal neurons lacking ankg exhibit a similar loss of sodium channels and other ais proteins [ 29 , 35 , 36 ] .\\nthus , ankg has a key role in ais development and stability and is required for the long - term health of the nervous system .\\nthe main proteins specifically accumulating in the ais plasma membrane include ion channels and cell adhesion molecules ( cams ) of the l1 family .\\nthese transmembrane proteins are recruited to the ais plasma membrane through interactions with the n - terminal membrane - binding domain of ankg .\\nais - enriched ion channels include voltage - gated sodium ( nav ) , potassium ( kv ) , and calcium ( cav ) channels .\\naccumulation of nav channels in the ais is essential for the local inward ion current that generates action potentials .\\nnav channels consist of four transmembrane domains ( numbered i  iv ) , each of which comprises six membrane - spanning segments .\\nnav channels bind ankg through an ais - targeting motif in the cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane domains i - ii [ 38 , 39 ] .\\nthe major nav channel subtypes enriched in the ais include nav 1.6 , nav 1.2 , and nav 1.1 , but the specific assortment of these channels and their longitudinal distribution along the ais ( e.g. , distal versus proximal ) depend on the specific type and developmental stage of the neuron [ 4042 ] .\\nthe observation that some channel subtypes can be asymmetrically distributed along the ais underscores the notion that the ais itself can be further subcompartmentalized along its length .\\nthe mechanisms contributing to this longitudinal asymmetry apparently include additional targeting determinants besides binding to ankg , because most ais transmembrane proteins , including the nav channel subtypes , bear a similar ankg binding site\\npotassium channel clustering at the ais is essential for regulating action potential firing because it suppresses neuron excitability [ 31 , 43 ] .\\nkv7.2 and kv7.3 ( kcnq2/3 ) bear an ais - targeting motif similar to that of nav channels and accumulate as both homomeric kv7.2 and heteromeric kv7.2/7.3 complexes . kv1.1 and\\nkv1.2 channels are also enriched at the ais . however , unlike kv7.2 and kv7.3 , they do not contain an identified ankyrin - binding motif . instead , kv1.1 and kv1.2 channels bind in the distal ais to the synaptic scaffolding protein psd-93 [ 44 , 45 ] , which is itself enriched there through an unknown mechanism . kv1.1 and kv1.2 function in conjunction with the calcium channels cav2 and cav3 ( which are distributed throughout the ais ) to modulate action potential initiation .\\nin addition to ion channels , the l1 cams neurofascin 186 ( nf-186 ) and neuronal cell adhesion molecule ( nrcam ) accumulate at the ais in an ankg - dependent manner . both nf-186 and nrcam are single - pass transmembrane proteins that contain a long chain of fibronectin and immunoglobulin repeats in their extracellular regions and bind ankg via a highly conserved sequence ( figqy ) on their cytoplasmic domains .\\ninterestingly , a single ankg molecule can accommodate at least two cams and one ion channel simultaneously .\\nthe significance of cams at the ais may involve linking the submembrane ais cytoskeleton to structures outside the ais , such as the extracellular matrix or other cells .\\nnf-186 in hippocampal neurons recruits components of the ais extracellular matrix ( e.g. , brevican ) .\\nfurthermore , nf-186 regulates formation and maintenance of gabaergic synapses between the ais of purkinje neurons and axonal terminals of basket interneurons .\\nthese axon - ais synapses are important for modulating synaptic integration and action potential initiation . due to the protein - protein interactions between the plasma membrane and submembrane regions , the components of the submembrane cytoskeleton ( e.g. , ankg and iv - spectrin )\\nregulate not only the recruitment and retention of ion channels and cams , but also their organization .\\nin addition , the ability of ion channels and cams to be anchored to the cytoskeletal network contributes to the role of ais in neuron polarity , not only to the electrical activity of the plasma membrane ( discussed further below ) .\\nthe region of the ais immediately beneath the plasma membrane contains the cytoskeletal proteins actin and iv - spectrin , as well as the n - terminal segment of the ankg molecule that interacts with transmembrane proteins and iv - spectrin .\\nspectrin molecules typically represent -heterotetramers ( two - and two -subunits ) that form 150200  nm long flexible rod - shaped structures .\\n-spectrin subunits typically consist of one incomplete spectrin repeat at the n - terminus , 20 complete spectrin repeats , an sh3 ( src homology 3 ) domain inserted into spectrin repeat 9 ( also known as spectrin repeat 10 for historical reasons ) , and a c - terminal domain containing two ef - hand motifs , only one of which can bind calcium ( figure 1(c ) ) .\\nclassical -spectrins comprise an n - terminal actin - binding domain , followed by 16 tandem full spectrin repeats , an incomplete 17th spectrin repeat , a variable region specific for individual -spectrin isoforms ( also known as the specific domain ) , and a c - terminal pleckstrin homology ( ph ) domain ( figure 1(c ) ) . within each spectrin tetramer , the incomplete spectrin repeats at the n - terminus of an -subunit and the c - terminus of a -subunit interact to form a complete spectrin repeat , forming a parallel longitudinal heterodimer that , in turn , associates with the second dimer in an antiparallel manner through lateral interaction between the first two -spectrin repeats and the last two -spectrin repeats ( figure 1(c ) ) .\\naccordingly , the two -spectrin subunits within tetramers orient with their n - terminal actin - binding domains at the two ends , where they can interact with actin filaments , and their c - termini facing each other , but not directly interacting , at the center of the molecule . -spectrin\\nthus , both ankyrins and actin filaments can interact with spectrin molecules by binding to the -spectrin , not the -spectrin , subunit . in the membrane cytoskeleton of erythrocytes ,\\nthe spectrin molecules are cross - linked by short actin filaments at so - called junctional complexes into a polygonal / triangular network , which gets tethered to the membrane primarily by ankyrin r , but also by components of the junctional complex [ 1115 ] . in mammals ,\\n-spectrins are encoded by five different genes , but only iv - spectrin has been found to specifically localize to the ais in mature neurons . the proline - rich specific domain ( sd ) of iv - spectrin between the 17th spectrin repeat and the ph domain has been hypothesized to confer specific functionality to iv - spectrins , possibly to allow the recruitment of unknown proteins to the ais or nodes of ranvier .\\nthe iv - spectrin gene is alternatively spliced to generate six isoforms ( iv1iv6 ) [ 30 , 54 ] .\\ntwo of these isoforms , iv1 and iv6 , are known to specifically cluster at the ais and nodes of ranvier in both peripheral and central nervous system neurons , whereas other iv - spectrin isoforms do not [ 54 , 55 ] .\\ninitially , iv1-spectrin was suggested to be most important since it is the only ais isoform containing an actin - binding domain , and its selective depletion from neurons causes ais and nodal disappearance .\\nhowever , the truncated iv6 isoform , which lacks the n - terminus and the first 10 spectrin repeats [ 54 , 55 ] ( figure 1(d ) ) , was shown to be more highly expressed relative to iv1   and specifically involved in nav channel stability at the ais and nodes of ranvier .\\nthis suggests that both isoforms may contribute to maintenance of ais membrane and cytoskeletal proteins .\\nhowever , the truncated iv6 isoform does not rescue the membrane instability ( detached wavy membranes ) resulting from the absence of iv1   and is not expected to interact with actin filaments . therefore , it is still unclear how iv6 spectrin contributes to cytoskeletal function .\\nthere are only two -spectrin genes in mammals , i - spectrin that is preferentially expressed in erythroid cells and ubiquitous ii - spectrin , both of which undergo alternative splicing to produce a variety of isoforms .\\ni- and i - spectrin subunits are the major components constituting the membrane skeleton of erythrocytes and are also expressed in a subset of neurons . neurons also express i/i2 and ii/ii1 ( known as brain spectrin ) subunits that , respectively , localize to the somatodendritic domain and primarily to the distal axon [ 58 , 59 ] . in purkinje neurons , iii - spectrin\\nalthough iv1 and iv6 can be immunoprecipitated from brain lysate by an ii spectrin antibody , immunolocalization data supporting the presence of ii spectrin in the ais are currently unavailable .\\nactin filaments are thin ( ~7  nm diameter ) helical polymers made of globular actin subunits .\\nactin filaments are dynamic and polarized , with polymerizing barbed ends and depolymerizing pointed ends . for some of their functions , actin filaments\\nexist as stable polymers with fixed lengths due to association of actin - binding proteins along the length and at the ends of the filaments .\\nfor instance , in junctional complexes of erythrocytes , actin filament length and stability are controlled , in part , by the pointed- and barbed - end capping proteins tropomodulin and adducin , respectively , and by tropomyosin along the length .\\nactin filaments were initially thought to be highly enriched in the ais and form the bulk of the diffusion barrier responsible for polarity [ 61 , 62 ] .\\nhowever , later studies revealed that although actin filaments are present in the ais , they are only minimally enriched there relative to the distal axon .\\nthese filaments are typically assumed to be relatively stable , similar to stabilized actin filaments in erythrocytes .\\nhowever , very little is known about the factors determining the stability of actin filaments in the ais . to date , neither tropomodulin nor tropomyosin has been identified in the proximal or distal axon .\\nthe barbed - end capping protein adducin , on the other hand , is present and colocalizes with the axonal actin throughout neuron development .\\nhowever , the cytoskeleton - associated population of adducin in the proximal axon of young neurons is progressively lost from the ais as neurons mature .\\nalso , it is unclear to what extent iv - spectrin , or any other protein that may associate along the filament length in the ais , contributes to actin filament stability .\\ntherefore , mechanisms of actin stabilization in the ais remain an open question . the fine structure of the ais undercoat , which by thin section electron microscopy appeared as a fuzzy layer underneath the plasma membrane , was recently resolved in great detail by platinum replica electron microscopy ( prem ) ( figure 2 ) .\\nthis study demonstrated a remarkable density , as well as apparent elasticity , of the submembrane ais cytoskeleton and identified its key components at a macromolecular resolution using immunogold labeling .\\nthe overall picture emerging from this analysis is that the ais cytoskeleton represents a sophisticated and highly integrated network of submembrane and transmembrane proteins that overlays microtubules located in the ais interior .\\nthese findings provide structural evidence to support earlier ideas that ais - enriched proteins detectable by light microscopy compose the membrane undercoat .\\na complementary insight into organization of ais components on a global scale was obtained using subdiffraction fluorescence microscopy .\\nsimilar to other fluorescence techniques , subdiffraction microscopy evaluates only one or two labeled proteins at a time , which significantly decreases complexity of obtained images . at the same time\\nusing stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy ( storm ) , it was revealed that circumferential actin filament signals ( also called actin rings ) are periodically distributed throughout the entire length of the axon including the ais , and each actin ring is spaced ~190  nm apart from its neighbors ( figure 1 ) [ 16 , 18 , 20 ] .\\nthis spacing is thought to be created by spectrin molecules , because the length of typical -spectrin/-spectrin tetramers is ~190  nm .\\nindeed , c - termini of -spectrins ( ii in the distal axon and iv in the ais ) were found to localize in between adjacent actin rings , consistent with their position in the middle of the spectrin tetramer , while actin - binding n - termini colocalized with actin rings .\\nvisualization of iv - spectrin in the ais using 3d storm showed that both n- and c - terminal domains of iv - spectrin are located at the same plane within the submembrane cytoskeleton .\\nalthough the easiest interpretation of these findings is that iv - spectrin partners with an -spectrin to form conventional heterotetramers , a complication arises from the fact that no -spectrin has been identified so far in the ais .\\none possibility is that -spectrin is present in the ais but remains to be detected .\\nanother possibility is that one of the iv - spectrin isoforms ( possibly iv6 ) somehow substitutes -spectrin , although a biochemical mechanism for such substitution is obscure .\\nit is also unclear how iv6-spectrin is recruited to and arranges in the ais . given that the c - terminally directed iv - spectrin antibody detects both iv1 and iv6 isoforms and exhibits long - range periodicity that alternates with actin rings , c - termini of both isoforms likely colocalize at the center between actin rings .\\nit can align with iv1 underneath the plasma membrane or extend away from the periodic network toward the plasma membrane where it can help regulate nav channel clustering .\\nsince iv6 can localize to the ais in a iv1-independent manner , it is probably positioned between adjacent actin rings by interactions with ankg .\\nit would be interesting to see whether iv6 periodicity forms or remains in the absence of iv1 isoform .\\nankg and ankyrin b ( ankb ) were also observed by storm to exhibit periodic localization between adjacent actin rings in the ais and distal axon , respectively .\\nthe periodicity and spacing of ankyrins likely depend on -spectrin , since ankyrin binds -spectrin close to -spectrin 's c - terminus .\\nhowever , the periodicity of ankyrins is less robust compared with that of actin and -spectrins , likely because each spectrin tetramer contains at least two ankyrin - binding sites , each located slightly off - center of the spectrin molecule , which may or may not be fully occupied [ 52 , 53 ] . consistently , ankg\\nbinding partners in the ais , such as ion channels , also exhibit only a roughly periodic organization .\\nanalysis of ankg organization in the ais using domain - specific antibodies showed that while the n - terminal spectrin - binding and serine - rich domains of ankg both exhibit a periodic pattern , the c - terminal regions of ankg display poor regularity [ 16 , 18 , 20 ] .\\nthis arrangement further confirms that iv - spectin imposes periodicity on the ankg n - terminus containing the spectrin - binding site , whereas the unstructured c - terminal tail of ankg gradually loses its periodicity [ 16 , 18 ] and exends internally into the ais cytoplasm ( discussed later ) .\\nthere are also important outstanding questions relating to the nature of the periodic actin rings . by analogy with erythrocytes ,\\nactin within rings was suggested to represent short , stable filaments since they colocalize with adducin in the axon .\\nhowever , the actual length of such filaments remains unknown and their stability is questionable .\\nthus , a significant portion of actin is depleted from actin rings in the ais after treatment with the actin depolymerizing drug latrunculin a , while the remaining actin still exhibits periodic organization .\\nin contrast , latrunculin a treatment completely disrupts actin periodicity in distal axons [ 18 , 20 ] . since adducin has been characterized as a weak barbed - end capping protein ( relative to other barbed - end cappers , such as gelsolin or capz )   and other actin - stabilizing proteins , such as tropomodulin and tropomyosin ,\\nhave not yet been reported to localize to axonal rings , the partial stability of actin filaments in the axon is not too surprising . as for the ais , maturation - dependent loss of adducin from this region   makes the state of actin filaments deduced from the storm data even less certain .\\ndirect visualization of actin filaments by prem after their selective labeling by myosin subfragment 1 or immunogold revealed that , in the ais submembrane cytoskeleton , actin exists as two populations of filaments : relatively long ( ~330  nm ) filaments that can be classified as dynamic because they are sensitive to both the actin depolymerizing drug latrunculin b in live neurons and severing by gelsolin in cytoskeletal preparations and short stable filaments that exhibit resistance to these treatments .\\nsubmicrometer long actin filaments have not been explicitly reported by studies applying subdiffraction fluorescence microscopy , although they are visible in the ais by wide field fluorescence microscopy as bright diffraction - limited puncta .\\nalthough short stable actin filaments in prem images seem to be good candidates to correspond to actin rings observed by subdiffraction techniques , they did not display obvious periodicity in prem images of the ais .\\nconsidering an ability of the prem preparation procedure to preserve even dynamic actin filaments in the ais , it is odd that it causes a significant loss of actin filaments from the rings that are assumed to be stable , although a partial loss can not be excluded .\\nit is also possible that the actin - spectrin network acquires periodic organization in response to longitudinal tension , which exists in living neurons , but is released following detergent extraction that is required to expose the cytoskeleton for prem analysis . in this scenario ,\\nwhether periodic actin rings in neurons have functional significance or simply result from longitudinal stretching of the submembrane network remains undetermined . on the other hand ,\\nseparate functions have been defined for stable and dynamic populations of actin filaments in the ais .\\nwhen both actin filaments and microtubules are depolymerized in membrane - extracted hippocampal neurons , the ais submembrane cytoskeleton remains completely intact and short stable actin filaments remain incorporated in the cytoskeletal network , although dynamic actin filaments are removed .\\nthus , we speculate that the short stable actin filaments are likely crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of the ais submembrane cytoskeleton , probably by linking spectrin molecules , roughly similar to junctional complexes in erythrocytes . on the other hand ,\\nthe longer dynamic filaments may play an essential role in the structural dynamics or plasticity of the ais .\\nthis idea is supported by the finding that , in live hippocampal neurons treated with latrunculin b , the submembrane cytoskeleton appears damaged ( containing holes or gaps ) at ais branch junctions where , under normal conditions , the cytoskeletal network appears to undergo  stretching  in response to tension exerted by the axonal branch .\\nprobably , dynamic actin contributes to a repair mechanism in instances where the cytoskeletal network is damaged due to breakage in response to mechanical stress .\\nthe ais is also known to undergo changes in both position and length as a possible way to fine - tune neuronal excitability [ 6466 ] .\\ntogether , recent studies using electron or subdiffraction fluorescence microscopy indicate that the submembrane cytoskeletal components form a sophisticated network in the ais that is conceptually similar to the polygonal / triangular network of erythrocytes [ 1620 ] . in this submembrane ankg/iv - spectrin / actin cytoskeleton\\n, iv - spectrin ( with or without an -spectrin partner ) appears to arrange longitudinally along the ais length , where it links adjacent actin rings .\\nsome geometrical differences in the organization of the network components in neurons and erythrocytes may arise from different distribution of intracellular forces and distinct shapes of these cells .\\nankg binds to the spectrin - actin network via its spectrin - binding domain and links the plasma membane to this network by binding ion channels and cams via its membrane - binding domain .\\nthe c - terminal region of ankg extends into the ais cytosplasm where it may link the spectrin - actin network to intracellular cytoskeletal components .\\nevidence of an ais diffusion barrier first derived from the observation that fluorescent lipids in the plasma membrane of cultured hippocampal neurons are incapable of spreading from the distal axonal domain , where they diffuse freely , to the somatodendritic domain .\\nsubsequent studies revealed that diffusion of plasma membrane proteins across the ais is also blocked [ 5 , 67 ] .\\nthe restricted mobility of both proteins and lipids in the ais is thought to rely on the submembrane cytoskeleton .\\ndisrupting the actin cytoskeleton by latrunculin b treatment increases the intrinsic mobility within the ais of l1 cam ( a transmembrane protein ) and thy-1 ( a gpi - anchored protein , which therefore spans only the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane ) , as well as of single fluorescently labeled lipids tracked by live cell imaging .\\nfurthermore , when beads attached to l1 or thy-1 were dragged using optical tweezers in the ais plasma membrane , they moved longer distances after exposure to latrunculin b. based on these observations , nakada et al .\\n( 2003 ) proposed the anchored - protein picket model , implicating the submembrane cytoskeleton as a key contributor to barrier function . according to this model , the mobility of plasma membrane components , both proteins and lipids ,\\npickets ,  that are themselves immobilized through anchorage to the underlying actin cytoskeleton , or  fence \\n, the role of the fence should be assigned to the submembrane meshwork dominated by spectrin and ankg with a small amount of actin , rather than to a dense actin meshwork , as proposed by the authors .\\nthe anchored proteins , or pickets , likely correspond to ion channels and cams which cluster in the ais plasma membrane and attach to the submembrane cytoskeleton through ankg . in support of this idea , it has been shown that the barrier forms only after ankg - dependent immobilization of nav channels , and ankg accumulation alone is insufficient for barrier function .\\ncomponents of the ais submembrane cytoskeleton that associate with plasma membrane lipids may also contribute , directly or indirectly , to the pickets .\\nfor example , ankg is anchored to the plasma membrane at its n - terminal region via a palmitoyl anchor .\\nin addition , iv - spectrin is thought to associate with plasma membrane phosphoinositides via its ph domain , and mice lacking iv - spectrin ph domains exhibit nodes of ranvier with impaired molecular and structural polarity [ 30 , 70 , 71 ] .\\nthe ais plasma membrane lipid composition may also affect membrane fluidity and thus diffusion barrier function , but this aspect of ais organization is largely understudied .\\nit appears that the barrier functions primarily through protein crowding within the ais and that the specific organization of plasma membrane and cytoskeletal components may be irrelevant for barrier function .\\nfor example , if ais organization was important for barrier function , then one would expect the barrier to form during or after ais arranges into a periodic pattern .\\nin contrast , available data show that the barrier is already functional between 7 and 10 days in vitro ( div ) , whereas the ais becomes periodic only at 12 div .\\nhowever , potentially different culture conditions in these unrelated studies make interpretation difficult , so it would be helpful to address this question within the same study .\\nregardless of an effect of periodicity , the submembrane cytoskeleton appears to contribute to the ais diffusion barrier primarily by providing a platform on which proteins are anchored , thereby allowing them to restrict the mobility of plasma membrane components through either steric hindrance or direct interactions , potentially independent of ais - specific organization [ 61 , 62 ] . would axons actually lose polarity if the ais submembrane cytoskeleton is disrupted ? in this respect , experiments disrupting actin filaments are not fully informative , because of critical impact on many other aspects of neuronal function that would confound the results . on the other hand , targeting an ais - specific protein , for example , ankg , would less likely introduce secondary consequences that might also affect polarity .\\ndepletion of ankg in cultured hippocampal neurons not only dismantles the ais but also causes axons to partially lose their identity : they acquire both membrane and cytoplasmic proteins that are normally found exclusively in the somatodendritic domain .\\nmore importantly , these axons also develop spines and excitatory postsynaptic densities within their proximal regions , a phenomenon also observed in neurons lacking ankg in vivo .\\nthese data support the idea that ankg - dependent submembrane cytoskeleton in the ais is important for neuron polarity .\\nhowever , disruption of axon identity is only partial ( i.e. , proximal ) following ais disassembly , because more distal axon regions retain axonal markers .\\ntherefore , additional investigation is required to determine whether a distal barrier exists in axons or whether other mechanisms contribute to maintenance of axon identity in this region .\\nsince knockout of iv - spectrin resulted in partial loss of nav channels and ankg from the ais and nodes of ranvier [ 30 , 55 , 56 , 74 ] , it is also expected to contribute to neuron polarity , but experiments directly testing a role for iv - spectrin in maintaining axonal or somatodendritic identity are lacking .\\nlike elsewhere in neurons , the cytoplasm of the ais contains microtubules , neurofilaments , and actin filaments , but differences exist in the ais in terms of the structure and organization of these filaments .\\nin addition , since the unstructured c - terminal tail of ankg extends into the ais cytoplasm , where it performs potential interactions with cytoplasmic components , we treat it here as a constituent of the inner ais shaft .\\ncross - sectional views of the ais obtained by 3d storm imaging demonstrated that the c - terminal tail domain of ankg extends below the submembrane spectrin - actin network to an average depth of 26  nm relative to the iv - spectrin c - terminus and a maximum depth of ~140  nm , into the intracellular ais shaft .\\nthe depth of ~140  nm likely reflects the maximal intrinsic length of ankg molecules in cells , as suggested by immunogold prem data revealing some ankg molecules as thin curvy filaments that can reach up to ~150  nm in length [ 19 , 75 ] . by penetrating deep into the ais cytoplasm\\nhowever , instances of deeply penetrating ankg tails were infrequent , suggesting that they rarely reach microtubule fascicles , which according to electron microscopy data are present throughout the ais interior [ 9 , 10 , 76 ] .\\nin contrast , based on 3d storm data , microtubules were reported to display an average depth of 85  nm below the plasma membrane , suggesting predominantly peripheral localization of microtubules in the ais , which seems to conflict with electron micrographs of thin tissue sections [ 9 , 10 , 76 ] .\\nfuture analyses are needed to resolve this discrepancy . in both the ais and distal axon\\n, microtubules are uniformly oriented with their plus ends pointed toward the axonal tips , whereas in dendrites microtubules generally have mixed orientation , with their plus ends facing either toward or away from the soma [ 7779 ] . cross sections through the distal axon and dendrites reveal microtubules spaced 25  nm and 65  nm apart , respectively .\\nthis difference in interfilament spacing is likely due to interaction with different microtubule associated proteins ( maps ) , which are known to regulate microtubule bundling . map1b and\\ntau mainly decorate microtubules in axons [ 8184 ] , whereas map2 localizes specifically to the somatodendritic domain [ 8587 ] .\\nexpression of tau and map2 in nonneuronal cells results in microtubules with an interfilament spacing of 25  nm and 65  nm , respectively , similar to that observed in axons and dendrites . in the ais , microtubules are more tightly packed into fascicles .\\na microtubule fascicle can be defined as a collection of individual microtubules that align parallel with one another and are closely cross - linked into a bundle . unlike the distal axon or somatodendritic domain , microtubules within ais fascicles\\nare each coated by a cloud of dense material , likely corresponding to maps or other regulatory proteins , and connected to neighboring microtubules by thin fibrils that create 12  nm bridges [ 9 , 10 ] .\\nthese bridges link the parallel microtubules together into a series , such that ( in cross section ) each fascicle appears to form a branched or linear chain . depending on the neuronal type and the diameter of the ais , the number of fascicles can range from about 3 to 7 , and\\nthe number of individual microtubules within each fascicle can vary from 2 to 25 . in electron\\nmicrographs , aiss often appear to contain 13 individual microtubules that are not fasciculated . like microtubules in fascicules ,\\nthese individual ais microtubules are surrounded by a cloud of dense material and often appeared to contain one or two fibrils extending from the surfaces , thus indicating that individual ais microtubules are likely structurally similar to microtubules within fascicles .\\nfascicles may be considered the main distinctive feature of the ais because they are absent from all other neuronal regions , even nodes of ranvier , where microtubules are evenly dispersed and display a loosely bundled or nonbundled arrangement .\\nthe lack of fascicles in nodes of ranvier may be unexpected since nodes share many features with the ais , including a similar membrane and submembrane protein composition [ 8 , 88 , 89 ] and periodic organization of the submembrane cytoskeleton .\\non the other hand , nodes of ranvier in contrast to the ais have not been implicated in polarity function , suggesting that fasciculation of microtubules may be specifically relevant to the role of the ais in determination of neuron polarity .\\na recent study identified the axonal map tripartite motif containing ( trim ) protein , trim46 , as a potential key contributor to formation and maintenance of ais microtubule fascicles .\\nin particular , when expressed in hela cells trim46 induces bundles comprising ~59 individual microtubules spaced similarly to microtubules in ais fascicles . in various neuronal types ,\\ntrim46 localizes specifically to microtubules in the proximal axon , but not in nodes of ranvier .\\nin addition , during early neuronal development , trim46 accumulates in a single neurite ( i.e. , the future axon ) even before it can be morphologically identified as an axon .\\nsuch an early arrival of trim46 to the future axon is consistent with the prem data showing that microtubule fasciculation is already apparent by 3 div .\\nhowever , it is still unclear whether ais - specific fascicles are unbundled or fail to form in the absence of trim46 , although trim46 knockdown inhibits early stages of neuron polarization and affects vesicular trafficking in axons .\\nperhaps the primary function of trim46 is to organize ais microtubules into uniform parallel arrays , an idea that is supported by data showing microtubules displaying mixed orientation in the proximal axon of trim46-depleted hippocampal neurons .\\nadditional promising candidates for generating or maintaining microtubule fascicles include the microtubule end binding ( eb ) proteins , members of a family of microtubule plus - end tracking proteins ( + tips ) , that were found to accumulate in the ais [ 91 , 92 ] . normally , eb proteins dynamically bind to the plus ends of growing microtubules where they regulate microtubule growth .\\nboth generic eb1 and neuron - specific eb3 display plus - end tracking activity in axons and dendrites [ 78 , 9397 ] .\\nin contrast , eb proteins in the ais are thought to be stably bound along the entire length of microtubule fascicles .\\nhowever , reports on the timing of eb protein localization in the ais during development are conflicting .\\ninitial experiments showed eb association along the microtubule lattice only when the ais is mature , indicating that eb proteins likely do not initiate fascicle formation , which occurs very early during ais development , but may instead contribute to maintaining fascicles . in a more recent study , however , eb proteins were found to localize to proximal axons as early as 2 div where they interact specifically with the 480  kd ankg isoform and are important for ankg accumulation and stability at the early ais .\\nthus , cooperation between eb proteins and 480  kd ankg may specify the position of the ais during early development .\\nfurther investigation is required to resolve the developmental timing of eb protein accumulation at the ais and to determine whether eb proteins have a direct role in microtubule fasciculation . aside from forming periodic rings as in the submembrane cytoskeleton , actin can form other stuctures within the ais and axon .\\nfor example , in axons , actin is often found organized in small patches of branched - filament meshworks .\\nthese small actin patches serve as precursors to filopodia , which can in turn give rise to axonal , and possibly ais , branches [ 17 , 19 , 99 , 100 ] .\\nthere is also evidence that ais actin patches may additionally provide scaffolding support for presynaptic boutons , since the patches colocalize with presynaptic markers [ 17 , 101 , 102 ] .\\nsome actin patches are also thought to function in vesicular transport ( discussed below ) .\\nsubdiffraction microscopy also showed that actin filaments appear to form bundles along the ais and distal axon that vary in length and localization depending on the age of the neuron [ 17 , 20 ] .\\nhowever , to what extent actin patches and bundles reside in the ais interior or whether they mostly represent surface structures remains to be shown .\\nneurofilaments are a class of intermediate filaments and display a diameter of ~10  nm .\\nneurofilaments are abundant in axons where they play an important role in regulating axon diameter , which in turn affects the velocity of electrical signal conductance [ 35 , 104108 ] .\\nthis ability of neurofilaments to control axon diameter , and therefore signaling , depends on the density of and spacing between filaments .\\nthe interfilament spacing is determined by phosphorylation of neurofilament subunits , resulting in small extensions with the appearance of hair - like  side - arms  that bind neighboring filaments [ 109111 ] . in the distal axon ,\\nneurofilaments are arranged longitudinally in parallel with one another , exhibit an interfilament spacing of 3349  nm [ 112 , 113 ] , and often appear curvy due to their intrinsic flexibility .\\nin contrast , neurofilaments in nonmyelinated axon regions , probably , including ais , are more closely bundled   and form straight parallel arrays [ 9 , 10 ] .\\nmore linear ais neurofilaments may generate if they are under greater tension than in the distal axon .\\nalternatively , neurofilaments in the ais may straighten and be more closely spaced due to their different properties because ais neurofilaments are known to be less phosphorylated than in the distal axon .\\nalthough very little attention has been given to the organization and structure of ais neurofilaments , they may be critical for proper ais function .\\nfor example , changes in the spacing and density of neurofilaments have been associated with both alterations in ais diameter and early pathological changes in motor neuron disease .\\nclearly , ais intracellular cytoskeleton components exhibit organizational and structrural features that are distinct from distal axon and somatodendritic regions .\\nstraight parallel neurofilaments and microtubule fascicles present the most distinct structural features of the ais interior cytoskeleton .\\nhowever , the mechanistic basis underlying formation of these stuctures is not fully clear . to be an effective regulator of neuron polarity ,\\nthe ais must control not only the diffusion of membrane components in the proximal axon , but also the cytoplasmic distribution of axonal and somatodendritic constituents .\\nthis function is attributed to the intracellular selective filter , a multifaceted but not fully understood mechanism that allows only certain organelles and molecules to enter the axonal domain , while preventing the entry of other components destined for dendrites .\\nfor example , live cell imaging of fluorescently tagged proteins shows that axonal constituents can enter both axonal and dendritic domains , while somatodendritic proteins are blocked from invading axons [ 117 , 118 ] .\\nthe intracellular selective filter can be divided into two distinct processes that involve ( 1 ) active directional transport and ( 2 ) a passive cytoplasmic diffusional barrier . both of these processes are dependent on the integrity of microtubules and actin filaments and possibly other components in the ais cytoskeleton .\\naccordingly , microtubules in the ais are thought to contribute to the filter by forming oriented tracks for polarized vesicular transport by the molecular motors kinesin and dynein .\\nsince dynein moves along microtubules toward their minus ends and when artificially linked to organelles can target them to dendrites , it has been hypothesized that this motor may be important for excluding dendritic proteins from axons . in support of this view\\n, dynein activator nuclear distribution element - like 1 ( ndel ) accumulates at the ais in an ankg - dependent manner , along with the ndel binding partner lis1 .\\nndel - based dynein activation in the ais functions to reverse traffic of somatodendritic vesicles , since deletion of ndel or lis1 results in the axonal entry of dendritic cargo , including transferrin receptor and the ampa receptor subunits glur1 and glur2 .\\nkinesin motors may help to selectively deliver axonal constituents , because they generally move toward the plus ends of microtubules , resulting in transport from the soma into axons .\\nindeed , kinesin kif5b drives the axonal transport of the synaptic protein vamp2 that functions in axons .\\nfor example , kinesin kif17 transports the nmda receptor subunit nr2b that functions in dendrites . nonetheless , the situation is not so simple , because kif5 ( e.g. , kif5b ) has been shown to drive transport of both axonal and somatodendritic proteins .\\n( 2009 ) addressed the question of ais filter selectivity for motor proteins and their associated cargo by analyzing the transport of kif5b and kif17 chimeras .\\nthey revealed that permissive vesicular transport toward the axon depends more on features of the motor - cargo complex rather than the type of motor alone .\\nadditional determinants of protein trafficking across the ais may involve features of the microtubule tracks themselves .\\nfor example , nakata and hirokawa , ( 2003 ) revealed preferential binding of ais microtubules by kif5 .\\nthis preference was suggested to involve ais - specific posttranslational modifications ( e.g. , acetylation , detyrosination , and polyglutamylation ) or increased gtp presence in the ais microtubules ( reviewed in ) . some ais - specific maps that constitute the dense coating of microtubules in the ais\\nfurthermore , formation of microtubule fascicles in the ais may also serve as a selectivity signal . for example , a specific arrangement of motors on the axonal cargo may take advantage of fasciculated microtubules , whereas a different arrangement of motors on the dendritic cargo may be incompatible with fasciculated tracks .\\nit remains to be shown whether fasciculated and individual ais microtubules have distinct roles in protein trafficking across the ais .\\nactin filaments may contribute to the intracellular selective filter by serving as tracks for myosin motors .\\nmyosin v that walks toward the barbed ends of actin filaments and myosin vi that travels toward the pointed ends play important roles for transporting somatodendritic and axonal proteins , respectively , to their proper locations in neurons [ 123 , 124 ] .\\nmoreover , watanabe et al . observed that nonspecific cargo linked to myosin vi proceeds unimpeded from the cell body through the ais toward the distal axon , whereas vesicles linked to myosin v are stalled in the ais and prevented from entering the distal axon , or occasionally reverted back to the cell body .\\nthese data suggest that actin filaments within the ais may be uniformly oriented with their barbed ends facing the soma , which would allow them to act as a selective filter by excluding somatodendritic proteins from entering the axon through myosin v , while simultaneously selecting axonal proteins to enter the axon via myosin vi\\ncorrelation of vesicle movements with localization of actin filaments examined by fluorescence microscopy after fixing the cells revealed that vesicles linked to myosin v were stalled at discrete actin patches . by electron microscopy\\nthis morphology is not fully consistent with the idea of longitudinally oriented tracks with uniform polarity , although it is conceivable that these patches may trap vesicles .\\ndirect determination of actin filament polarity using decoration with myosin subfragment 1 showed that actin filaments in the ais have random orientation and thus are not expected to support polarized transport .\\nnotably , both studies use prem and thus primarily visualize surface structures , raising a possibility that the cytoplasmic actin filaments predicted to form oriented tracts remain undetected in the ais interior .\\none argument against this possibility is that oriented actin tracks are still undetectable in ais regions having relatively sparse submembrane cytoskeleton , where examination of the ais interior is possible .\\n( 2015 ) detected a population of somatodendritic actin filament bundles , which end at the proximal border of the ais and suggested that this  organizational border  may also ( or instead ) support the selective filter by causing the abrupt arrest of dendritic cargo attempting to enter the axon , but this idea remains to be tested .\\nthe actin cytoskeleton also contributes to the intracellular diffusion of specific cargo through the ais . by tracking fluorescently labeled dextrans of various molecular weights in hippocampal neurons , song et al .\\n( 2001 ) showed that large dextrans are prevented from entering the axon between 3 and 5 div , during the time of ais formation , but can diffuse across the ais after depolymerization of actin filaments by latrunculin a. these data suggested the presence of a size - selective sieve in the ais interior that depends on integrity of the actin cytoskeleton .\\nhowever , specific configuration of the sieve is unclear . if it is actin filaments that make a cytoplasmic size - exclusion sieve in the ais cytoplasm , they should be sufficiently dense and thus significantly enriched in the ais , which is not the case .\\ninterestingly , rnai - mediated knockdown of ankg also allows for dextran diffusion across the ais .\\na proposed explanation for this effect is that the c - terminal cytoplasmic tail of ankg extends into the ais interior , where it links to microtubules to form a sieve that blocks the entry of macromolecules into the axon .\\nhowever , further investigation is needed on this point since the ankg c - terminus penetrates on average only ~26  nm into the ais interior , which seems insufficient for making a sieve with an appropriate density by interacting with microtubule fascicles located deep in the ais cytoplasm .\\ntherefore , it remains unclear how disruption of ankg and actin filaments produces similar phenotypes in terms of regulating the selective filter .\\nin addition , microtubules may contribute to maintaining asymmetric accumulation of proteins in axons via a sequestration mechanism , rather than through motor - dependent traffic .\\n( 2011 ) showed that when microtubules are depleted , the axonal map tau , which is normally bound to microtubules in axons , passes through the ais and invades the somatodendritic domain , without affecting ankg clustering .\\nthese data suggest that microtubules may retain some axonal proteins and prevent them from retrograde diffusion into the somatodendritic domain .\\nthus , the existing observations show that the intracellular cytoplasmic filter in the ais contributes to maintaining the polarized distribution of somatodendritic and axonal components in neurons .\\nthe underlying mechanisms apparently include motor - driven vesicular transport along both microtubule and actin tracks , as well as an internal diffusion barrier that plays a more passive role .\\nindeed , with the exception of the ais - bound ndel - based activation of dynein , much of what is known regarding active directional transport in the ais has been extrapolated from roles of microtubules and microtubule - based motors in the distal axon .\\nfurther investigation is required to firmly establish the existence of a bona fide cytoplasmic selective filter in the ais that is distinct from other neuronal domains .\\nthe ais cytoskeleton is built during early neuronal development following axon specification . based on observations in vitro ,\\nwhen neurons are plated on a substrate , they start out as symmetrical cells containing a round soma with abundant lamellipodial protrusive activity at the perimeter ( stage 1 ) . eventually , these protrusions give way to multiple short processes of about equal length called neurites ( stage 2 ) . after approximately 1.5 days in vitro ( div ) ,\\nthe neurons become polarized as one of the neurites outgrows the others and differentiates ( molecularly and functionally ) to become an axon ( stage 3 ) . by 4 div ,\\nthe remaining neurites begin to slowly elongate and develop into highly branched dendrites ( stage 4 ) . after 7 div , the axon and\\nafter axon formation ( early stage 3 ) , ankg begins to cluster in the proximal axonal region , indicative of early ais assembly .\\nstructural analysis by prem of ais development revealed that microtubule bundling appears as the first sign of ais assembly in early div hippocampal neurons before signs of submembrane cytoskeletal assembly become detectable .\\nearly formation of fascicles by trim46 or eb proteins may initially help stabilize ankg in the ais and promote its clustering [ 128 , 129 ] , if the ankg c - terminal tail preferentially interacts , directly or indirectly , with bundled microtubules . in support of this idea , the c - terminal tail specific for the large ,\\n480  kd ankg isoform is necessary for the accumulation and stability of ankg in the ais of early hippocampal neurons and subsequent assembly of the ais .\\nalternatively , ankg may contribute to fasciculation of microtubules , because ankg is capable of both oligomerizing and binding microtubules , either directly   or indirectly ( e.g. , through eb proteins ) , and fascicles fail to form in ankg - depleted cerebellum axons . together , these observations suggest a possible cooperative relationship between early ankg clustering and microtubule fasciculation .\\nprem observations at different time points during neuron development revealed that the ais submembrane cytoskeleton undergoes structural reorganization over time ( figure 3 ) , which likely reflects arrival of additional ais proteins , as well as their spatial rearrangement .\\nimmunogold staining of individual ais proteins made it possible to link individual shapes within the ais submembrane cytoskeleton to specific proteins .\\nwhen the submembrane cytoskeleton in the ais begins to assemble over the bundled microtubules at 3 div , it initially adopts a sparse meshwork consisting of thin fibrillar elements and actin filaments .\\nthe thin fibrils likely represent a mixture of ankg , iv - spectrin , and some cam molecules , all of which have wavy linear shapes .\\nsubsequently , globular structures that display a range of shapes and sizes gradually accumulate in the ais cytoskeleton .\\nmany of these globules , especially those with donut - like shapes , likely represent various ion channels .\\nthey begin to noticeably appear at 7 div and become prevalent surface components of the ais by 21 div .\\ninterestingly , some globules also appear in elongated clusters that likely correspond to ankg molecules associated with ankg binding partners , such as ion channels . at 21 div\\n, the extreme density of putative ion channels on the ais surface renders the fibrillar structures nearly invisible , except in small spaces between globules .\\nhowever , these  windows  reveal the transition of thin fibrils from the mixed / meshwork - like configuration to a striking longitidinal orientation between 14 and 21 div .\\nthis rearrangement may reflect a transformation of relaxed wavy spectrin molecules to a stretched linear conformation , which likely accompanies the appearance of the periodic organization observed by light microscopy . the transition from meshwork to periodic organization in the ais submembrane cytoskeleton\\n( 2014 ) , who showed that ii - spectrin , an isoform enriched in distal axons , has an important role in formation of ais periodicity .\\nthey found that ii - spectrin adopts a periodic arrangement at the site of future ais as early as 2 div , before arrival of ais components .\\nankg and iv - spectrin that subsequently arrive to the ais adopt a periodic organization only after 12 div , which occurs in parallel with loss of ii - spectrin fluorescence intensity and periodicity in the proximal axon . additionally ,\\nknockdown of ii - spectrin in young neurons before the ais is established partially impairs iv - spectrin accumulation and periodicity .\\nthese data suggest that iv - spectrin and ankg incorporate into a preformed periodic template made by ii - spectrin in the ais submembrane cytoskeleton .\\nbecause the isoforms of spectrin are exchanged in this process and ankb is dispensable for ii - spectrin organization in axons , it seems that memory of periodicity resides in the actin - containing component of the ii - spectrin - based periodic structure .\\nnotably , adducin is also gradually lost from the ais during its maturation , suggesting that actin filaments in the periodic network may also change their partners during ais development .\\nan interesting speculation is whether this template mechanism is more important for certain aspects of ais submembrane cytoskeletal organization than ankg , even though ankg plays a key role in recruiting ais components .\\none possible scenario is that ankg operates primarily to recruit and retain ais components , while iv - spectrin ( in conjunction with ii - spectrin ) helps to fine - tune the submembrane cytoskeletal architecture into the periodic configuration .\\nit is generally agreed that ankg is a master organizer of the ais , but a major unresolved question is how ankg itself gets recruited to the proximal axon to start ais assembly .\\nit was initially proposed that ankg targeting involves multiple domains within the molecule that cooperate with each other .\\n( 2012 ) showed that s - palmitoylation at cysteine 70 within the ankg n - terminal membrane - binding domain is particularly required for targeting of ankg to the ais , as well as to lateral membranes in epithelial cells .\\ncooperation with eb proteins appears as another potential mechanism to specify the site of ankg clustering and ais localization .\\ngaliano and colleagues proposed a different model , an exclusion mechanism , for ankg accumulation in the proximal axon . according to this study\\n, ankg initially has a broad distribution in the axon , whereas components of the generic axonal submembrane cytoskeleton ( ankb , ii - spectrin , and ii - spectrin ) predominantly concentrate in the distal end of the axon .\\nas development of the neuron progresses , this generic cytoskeleton expands toward the soma where its advancing boundary forces the ankg - containing submembrane cytoskeleton to concentrate in the proximal axon .\\nsupporting this idea , depletion of ankb , ii - spectrin , or ii - spectrin results in the redistribution of ankg and iv - spectrin to the distal axon .\\n( 2014 ) , which places ii - spectrin - based submembrane cytoskeleton upstream of and as a requirement for the assembly of the ankg/iv - spectrin system in the proximal axon , and shows that it begins to assemble in the proximal , not distal , axon .\\npossibly , the discrepancy between the two studies exists due to differences of focus on periodic   versus total   pools of these cytoskeletal components .\\nadditional investigation is required to fully reconcile the findings of these two studies [ 18 , 127 ] .\\nchanges in actin filament organization during ais development have recently received attention . in the ais and distal axon ,\\nactin filaments assume different organizational forms , including actin rings , individual filaments , patches , and bundles .\\nas judged by subdiffraction fluorescence microscopy , periodic actin rings in developing neurons are formed only at 5 div , even though periodicity of ii - spectrin is detectable at 2 div ; this discrepancy is explained by potential technical difficulties of preserving actin in young neurons [ 18 , 20 ] .\\nprem analysis of actin filament distributions in the ais submembrane cytoskeleton showed that the two populations of individual actin filaments , long dynamic and short stable , exist during early neuron development and persist in mature aiss .\\nactin patches that may support development of presynaptic structures [ 17 , 101 , 102 ] and axon branches [ 17 , 19 , 99 , 100 ] form as early as 5 div throughout the axon .\\nlinear actin structures ( interpreted as actin filament bundles ) appear throughout axon development , although their abundance , length , and localization in the ais vary depending on neuronal age , without adopting any easily recognizable pattern . thus , these observations suggest that the actin cytoskeleton undergoes various changes during ais development .\\nalthough such changes may have functional consequences for different aspects of ais structure and function , these questions remain largely unanswered . compared with the distal axon\\nankg plays a major role in not only recruiting ais components , but also keeping them localized to the proximal axon through direct interactions .\\nthe ability of iv - spectrin to maintain proteins in the ais is unclear because the evidence is conflicting .\\ninitial studies reported that iv - spectrin , particularly the full - length iv1 isoform , is essential for ankg and nav localization at the ais because these proteins fail to properly cluster at the ais in neurons lacking this spectrin isoform [ 30 , 55 ] .\\nhowever , a later study showed that both ankg and nav remain localized to the ais after iv - spectrin depletion .\\ninterestingly , membrane proteins , such as cams , can also contribute to maintaining ais components .\\nfor example , although the ais fully assembles in the absence of neurofascin in vitro and in vivo , the long - term clustering of its components requires neurofascin [ 72 , 132 ] .\\nfinally , non - ais factors may also contribute to maintaining ais protein localization since , for example , the distal ankb/ii - spectrin/ii - spectrin network can act as a barrier that restricts ais components to the proximal axon . proteins also appear to be stably maintained within the ais network exhibiting very slow turnover . both ankg and iv - spectrin ( also ion channels and cams )\\nare long - lived in the ais , with half - lives of at least two weeks .\\nfurthermore , the periodic network in the ais is well maintained , compared with distal axons , following actin and microtubule perturbation in live neurons [ 18 , 20 ] .\\nit is not fully clear whether this stability is due to intrinsic properties of the periodic network or some other factors , such as interactions of the network with microtubule fascicles .\\nhowever , this latter possibility may be unlikely since the radial orientation of the c - terminal tail of ankg remains unperturbed following disruption of microtubules .\\nobservations by prem also indicate formation of a robust network among ais components because its structure remains largely intact for several hours following extraction of the plasma membrane and concomitant removal of actin filaments and microtubules prior to chemical fixation .\\nhere we focused on the cytoskeletal architecture of two distinct regions of the ais , beneath the plasma membrane and within the cytoplasm , and discussed how they contribute to the role of the ais in maintaining neuron polarity .\\ninvestigation of the ais at different developmental time points by electron and subdiffraction fluorescence microscopy has increased our understanding of how the ais assembles into a sophisticated network ( submembrane ) or acquires distinct structural features ( cytoplasmic ) . however , a full understanding of how specific proteins contribute to ais cytoskeletal organization is still lacking .\\ntherefore , it is essential to elucidate the arrangement and interactions of specific ankg and iv - spectrin isoforms and to determine their roles in the development , stability , and overall architecture of ais cytoskeleton .\\nin addition , it will be valuable to determine the significance of microtubule fascicles and to identify proteins involved in fascicle formation and maintenance .\\nsince the ais is fundamental to the ability of neurons to fire action potentials , it is important to determine whether changes in ais architecture ( e.g. , during ais development ) relate to changes in neuronal excitability .\\nit remains to be shown whether changes in ais architecture are accompanied by alternations in ais position or length , for example , in response to injury or disease .</td>\n",
